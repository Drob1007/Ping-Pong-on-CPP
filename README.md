# Ping Pong Game on C++
This repository contains my project on a classic Ping Pong game made on C++. This is my first C++ project and I have tried my best to simulate the game.

Ping Pong happens to be a very popular video game since the dawn of video games.

#### This game takes a console input/output based approach on displaying objects and controlling the game.
  
### How to play:
1. Clone the repository and open the directory
2. Run main.exe
  
#### Game Controls:
* **I Key** - to move right blade up.
* **K Key** - to move right blade down.
* **W Key** - to move left blade down.
* **S Key** - to move left blade down.
<b>

### Files Description:
* *main.cpp* - contains the source code (thoroughly explained through comments)
* *main.o* - object code
* *main.exe* - executable file for game
<b>

### Libraries Used:
* *iostream* - for outputting to screen (cout).
* *conio.h* - for listening for keys pressed.
* *ctime* - for generating random number seed.
* *cstdlib* - for generating random numbers.
<b>
  
### Code Description: - Details of code are thoruoughly described in comments with the code itself.
#### Classes:
* *Ball* - to store position of ball.
* *Blade* - to store position of blades.
* *Game* - to display the ball and blade and implement the logic.

#### Functions:
* *int main()* - main activity handler - to run the game loops.

## *Thanks for viewing my project.*
#### This project taught me many basic coding skill. The biggest challenge with the project was to make the ball move. This part of code required lot of efforts figuring out the geometry of grid.
##### Hope you like the efforts.
